            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Matthew Isip and Kyle Fink's Mobile Disc Golf Card Game. Below, you'll find a tutorial explaining the code, a video demonstration of the app, and a link to our presentation.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Code Tutorial</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                Our Disc Golf Card Game app was developed in Swift to be used by iOS devices.
                The IDE used for our project was XCode 16.0, which requires developers to use macOS.
            </p>
            <h3>Step-By-Step Instructions</h3>
            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
                Begin with planning out the project, the eventual appearance, functionality, and usability of the app at the end.
                Think about the different screens that will be used, and what features you want to see a part of those individual screens.
            </p>
            <h4>Start Screen</h4>
            <p>
                For this specific project, we will begin with the StartScreen.
                The features that we want this page to have are 2 inputs: one for how many players will be in the game and another for how many holes the user will be playing.
                On top of having multiple screens, we will also need to set up the navigation between the multiple screens.
            </p>
            <p>First, initialize the variables for player and hole selection:</p>
            <pre>
@State private var selectedPlayers: String = "2"
@State private var selectedHoles: String = "9"
            </pre>
            <p>
                This will initialize the variables, as well as set the defaults to 1 and 9.
                Next, we can begin working on the actual screen.
                To do so, we will utilize VStack. Inside of our VStack, we will include a mix of text and pickers. To create our title card, we will use the following:
            </p>
            <pre>
VStack(spacing: 16) {
    Text("Disc Golf Cards")
        .font(.largeTitle)
        .fontWeight(.bold)
    VStack {
        Text("Select Players")
        Picker("Players", selection: $selectedPlayers) {
            ForEach([“2”, “3”, “4”, “5”, “6”, “7”, “8”], id: \.self) { player in
                Text(player).tag(player)
            }
        }
    }
    VStack {
        Text("Select Holes")
        Picker("Holes", selection: $selectedHoles) {
            ForEach(["9", "18"], id: \.self) { hole in
                Text(hole).tag(hole)
            }
        }
    }
}
            </pre>
            <p>
                The same can be done for our holes selection, with the options of 9 or 18.
                The next step is to add a way to navigate away from the start screen once the user has made their selections.
                To do so, we will utilize NavigationLink.
            </p>
            <pre>
NavigationLink(
    destination: GameScreenView(
        players: Int(selectedPlayers) ?? 1,
        holes: Int(selectedHoles) ?? 9
    ),
    label: {
        Text("Start Game")
            .font(.title2)
            .padding()
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
            .background(Color.blue)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
)
.disabled(selectedPlayers.isEmpty || selectedHoles.isEmpty)
            </pre>
            <p>
                Adding the disabled field allows for the button to be non-accessible until the user has put in the required information.
                Having made the destination of the NavigationLink point to the new GameScreenView, the next step is to actually begin working on that page.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Screen</h4>
            <p>
                When planning out the features that we want to see on the game screen, we can think of displaying which player's turn it currently is, what hole the group is on, as well as functionality for players to draw cards, view their cards, and to have the ability to redraw a card or to move on to the next person.
                First, we will start by initializing our variables for the screen.
            </p>
            <p>Initialize the variables:</p>
            <pre>
@State private var currentTurn: Int = 1
@State private var currentHole: Int = 1
@State private var playerCards: [[(name: String, description: String)]] = []
@State private var playedCards: [(name: String, description: String)] = []
@State private var cardText: String = "No cards have been played yet."
@State private var isGameOver: Bool = false // New state to track game over

let allCards: [(name: String, description: String)] = generateDeck()
            </pre>
            <p>
                After creating our variables, it's now time to work on the actual widgets of the screen.
                To do so, we will create another VStack just like we did for the Start Screen.
            </p>
            <pre>
VStack(spacing: 16) {
    Text("Player \(currentTurn)'s Turn")
        .font(.title)
    Text("Hole \(currentHole)")
        .font(.headline)
    Text(cardText.isEmpty ? "Draw a card" : cardText)
        .font(.title2)
        .padding()
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.2))
        .cornerRadius(10)
    Button(action: { drawCard() }) {
        Text("Draw Card")
            .font(.title2)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.green)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
    Button(action: { nextTurn() }) {
        Text("Next Player")
            .font(.title2)
            .padding()
            .background(Color.blue)
            .foregroundColor(.white)
            .cornerRadius(10)
    }
}
            </pre>
            <h4>Next Turn Function</h4>
            <p>The <code>nextTurn</code> function updates the current player and hole number:</p>
            <pre>
private func nextTurn() {
    if currentTurn < players {
        currentTurn += 1
    } else {
        currentTurn = 1
        if currentHole < holes {
            currentHole += 1
        } else {
            cardText = "Game Over!"
        }
    }
}
            </pre>
            <h4>Creating the Cards</h4>
            <p>To create our cards, we will create an array of the different card names and 
                descriptions that we want to be able to play. Here we define the function that 
                returns the deck.
            </p>
            <pre>
private static func generateDeck() -> [(name: String, description: String)] {
    return [
        ("Mulligan", "Take another shot without penalty."),
        ("Skip a Hole", "Skip this hole without penalty."),
        . . .
        ("Heckle", "Heckle an opponent during one of their shots."),
        ("Cancel Card", "Cancel any card just played.")
    ]
}</pre>
        <p>Then when the game screen shows up, using the “<code>.onAppear</code>” we deal the starting cards to each player.</p>
        <pre>
.onAppear {
    dealInitialCards()
}</pre>
        <p>This function will deal 5 cards at random to each player to start the game and adds each card to an array called the player's hand. 
            This is what gets displayed on the game screen. To display the cards we use a vertical stack of buttons that have text for both the 
            “card.name” and “card.description”.</p>
        <pre>
VStack {
    if playerCards.indices.contains(currentTurn - 1) {
        ForEach(playerCards[currentTurn - 1], id: \.name) { card in
        Button(action: {
            playCard(card)
        }) {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Text(card.name)
                .font(.headline)
            Text(card.description)
                .font(.subheadline)
                .foregroundColor(.gray)
            }
            .padding()
            .background(Color.gray.opacity(0.2))
            .cornerRadius(8)
            }
        }
    } else {
        Text("No cards available").italic()
    }
}</pre>
        <p>When a player clicks on the card to play it a couple things happen. First the app finds what card has been clicked on by checking
             the name of the card. Then the app will print out that player 1 for example, played and then the description of the card. It 
             then adds that card to the played cards and moves to the next player or hole depending on who just went. When the app moves 
             to the next player it will draw one new card to replenish the card used ensuring each player always has at least 5 cards.</p>    
<pre>
private func playCard(_ card: (name: String, description: String)) {
    // Ensure the current player's cards exist
    guard playerCards.indices.contains(currentTurn - 1) else {
        cardText = "Error: Player \(currentTurn) has no cards."
        return
    }
    
    // Find the index of the card to be played
    if let index = playerCards[currentTurn - 1].firstIndex(where: { $0.name == card.name }) {
        playerCards[currentTurn - 1].remove(at: index)
        cardText = "Player \(currentTurn) played \(card.name): \(card.description)"
        playedCards.append(card)
        nextTurnOrHole()
    } else {
        // Handle case where the card isn't found
        cardText = "Error: Card not found in Player \(currentTurn)'s hand."
    }
}</pre>
        <p>The next turn or hole just checks if we are on the last player then we move to the next hole or if not then move to the next 
            player. It also checks if the hole number is the desired ending hole and clears all the cards and displays a thanks for playing 
            message. The next player button turns into a back to lobby button that will bring the player back to the lobby screen</p>
<pre>
private func nextTurnOrHole() {
    if currentTurn < players {
        // Move to the next player's turn
        currentTurn += 1
    } else {
        // All players have played; move to the next hole
        currentTurn = 1
        if currentHole < holes {
            currentHole += 1
        } else {
            // End game if all holes are played
            isGameOver = true // Set game over state
            clearAllCards()
        }
    }
    // Replenish cards for the current player at the start of their turn
    replenishCards(for: currentTurn - 1)
}</pre>
<p>Congratulations, you have finally completed building your Disc Golf Card Game! You also have now gained some knowledge into how to create projects
    in iOS using XCode, how to create screens using different types of widgets, and how to navigate between them once they are created.</p>
